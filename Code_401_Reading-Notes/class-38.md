# Redux: Async Logic

- So far all of our work has been inside of the client application, now we will look into fetching info from an API.

 >By itself, a Redux store doesn't know anything about async logic. It only knows how to synchronously dispatch actions, update the state by calling the root reducer function, and notify the UI that something has changed. Any asynchronicity has to happen outside the store.

[Redux Docs](https://redux.js.org/tutorials/fundamentals/part-6-async-logic)

- Since Redux cannot include any side effect we must create middleware to deal with these side effects

Lets take a look at some example code from the docs:

```js
import { client } from '../api/client'

const delayedActionMiddleware = storeAPI => next => action => {
  if (action.type === 'todos/todoAdded') {
    setTimeout(() => {
      // Delay this action by one second
      next(action)
    }, 1000)
    return
  }

  return next(action)
}

const fetchTodosMiddleware = storeAPI => next => action => {
  if (action.type === 'todos/fetchTodos') {
    // Make an API call to fetch todos from the server
    client.get('todos').then(todos => {
      // Dispatch an action with the todos we received
      storeAPI.dispatch({ type: 'todos/todosLoaded', payload: todos })
    })
  }

  return next(action)
}
```

Here is what an async function middleware would look like:

```js
const asyncFunctionMiddleware = storeAPI => next => action => {
  // If the "action" is actually a function instead...
  if (typeof action === 'function') {
    // then call the function and pass `dispatch` and `getState` as arguments
    return action(storeAPI.dispatch, storeAPI.getState)
  }

  // Otherwise, it's a normal action - send it onwards
  return next(action)
}
```

Then it could be used like this:

```js
const middlewareEnhancer = applyMiddleware(asyncFunctionMiddleware)
const store = createStore(rootReducer, middlewareEnhancer)

// Write a function that has `dispatch` and `getState` as arguments
const fetchSomeData = (dispatch, getState) => {
  // Make an async HTTP request
  client.get('todos').then(todos => {
    // Dispatch an action with the todos we received
    dispatch({ type: 'todos/todosLoaded', payload: todos })
    // Check the updated store state after dispatching
    const allTodos = getState().todos
    console.log('Number of todos after loading: ', allTodos.length)
  })
}

// Pass the _function_ we wrote to `dispatch`
store.dispatch(fetchSomeData)
// logs: 'Number of todos after loading: ###'
```

## Redux Async Data Flow

Once that dispatched value reaches a middleware, it can make an async call, and then dispatch a real action object when the async call completes.
