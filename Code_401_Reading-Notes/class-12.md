  - Session
    - Keeps connection and controls ports
  - Transport
    - Where the transmission of data occurs using TCP and UDP
  - Network
    - Determines which path data will take
  - Data Link
    - Determines the format of data on the network
  - Physical
    - Transmition of raw bit stream over the physical medium
