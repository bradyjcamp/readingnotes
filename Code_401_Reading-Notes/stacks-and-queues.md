# Stacks and Queues

## What is a Stack?

[A stack](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/stacks_and_queues.html) is another DSA that includes Nodes.

Some common terminology include:

- Push
  - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
- Pop
  - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- Top
  - This is the top of the stack.
- Peek
  - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- IsEmpty
  - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

## What is a Queue?

A queue is similar to a stack but uses different terminology and takes a different shape.

Some common terminology include:

- Enqueue
  - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
- Dequeue
  - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- Front
  - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
- Rear
  - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
- Peek
  - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
- IsEmpty
  - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
