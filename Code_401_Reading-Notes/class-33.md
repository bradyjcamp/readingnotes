>Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts network access based on a person's role within an organization and has become one of the main methods for advanced access control. The roles in RBAC refer to the levels of access that employees have to the network.

- The benefits of RBAC are that you can control access based on roles.
  - You can assign admin priveledges, editor, writer, and so on.
  - Each of these roles would have different levels of authentication.

- With simple methods such as `.load()`, `.select()`, and `.save()`, you can manage and set up when and what cookies to use.
