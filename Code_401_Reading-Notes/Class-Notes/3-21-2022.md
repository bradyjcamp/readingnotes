## Node

- Node is a runtime environment for JavaScript
  - Typically the runtime environment we are used to is the Browser.
  - A **runtime environment** is a place where we feed JavaScript.
    - Parse and execute our JS.
      - V8 engine - run in **Google Chrome** and **node**
    - Responsible for providing tools and global variables that code can *use*.
  - `require()` - function that node provides in our runtime environment.
- `process` is nodes object version globally defined where as `document` is the browsers or windows object globally defined.
