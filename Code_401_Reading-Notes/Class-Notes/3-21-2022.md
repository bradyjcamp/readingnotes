# Node, Tests, Continuous

## Node

- Node is a runtime environment for JavaScript
  - Typically the runtime environment we are used to is the Browser.
  - A **runtime environment** is a place where we feed JavaScript.
    - Parse and execute our JS.
      - V8 engine - run in **Google Chrome** and **node**
    - Responsible for providing tools and global variables that code can *use*.
  - `require()` - function that node provides in our runtime environment.
- `process` is nodes object version globally defined where as `document` is the browsers or windows object globally defined.
- Allows us to export and import **modules**

### Node Modules

- A folder where all of our node packages live.
  - These can be used by requiring them in.
- A node module can also be where our callback function or other functionality lives and is exported to another file.
- Communicates with another file or action.
- **JavaScript that "exports" something to be used elsewhere** `module.exports = something`.
- We then have to `require` it or import it into a specific file.
