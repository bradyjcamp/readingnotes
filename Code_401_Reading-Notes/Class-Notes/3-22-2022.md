# Express

## Routing

- HTTP framework
  - a route is used to match to a service or function / program.
- Express does not need any extra configuring to setup and use.

### Require Function

- Provides a single object to another code context or file.
  - When you require something, the code from the path requested gets parsed and executed.
  - After all the code is run, require returns whatever is specified in the `module.exports = something`.
  - In JavaScript, a funciton is also an object. There are many things that can be considered objects in JavaScript.
- If your JS executes something, this is called a **side effect**.

### Middleware

- Software that runs between two programs. In the middle.
- **Express Middleware** is a function that must receive a `request`, `response` object, as well as a `next` function.
  - All functions in express fit between the `request` and `response`.
  [Repl Example](https://replit.com/@BradyCamp2/401-Middleware#index.js)

### Request

- Any info originating from the client.
- Client side info like what made the request and where

  - Request params


### Response

- Response sent back from the middleware
- It could be data, a messages, a status, or any info sent back to client after the request

### Next

- Function that signals that `middleware` is done, and can move on to the next one.
