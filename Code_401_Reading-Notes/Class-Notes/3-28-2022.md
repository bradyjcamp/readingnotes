# Authentication

## Encoding vs Encryption

- **Encoding**: using a standardized communication method.
  - **base64**: 'Hello Brady!' => 'asdf78765a85g'.
    - binary to text encoding.
- **Encryption**: Hiding information from everyone.
  - **bcrypt**
    - used to hash passwords.
    - it is a one way encryption and cannot be decrypted, only compared.
  - Can only be decrypted or parsed using a *key*.

## Basic Authentication (BA)

- Create a route to 'register' / 'signup'.
  - Takes in a username and password as a JSON body.
  - Immediately encrypt password, and store in User table(DB).
  
- Encode BA cedentials and attach to a header via base64.
- Read the auth header and decode momentarily.
- use *sequelize* to find a user based on provided username.
  - if there is one found then we use bcrypt to compare password from header with encrypted password from DB.
  - if true, request is validated.
  - if false, return 401 error: Unauthorized status.
