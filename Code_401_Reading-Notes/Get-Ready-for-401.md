## Solving Problems

- [Avoiding Coding Right Away and Set Steps](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)
  - Read the problem completely twice
    - If you do not understand the problem then you will not be able to solve it so this step is very important.
  - Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
    - Solving a problem manually will allow you to visually see how the calculation and solution is achieved.
    - Since programming is an automated approach it is helpful to work things manually to fully understand what needs to happen.
  - Optimize the manual steps.
    - Look at the different approaches to manually solving the solution and try and find the simplest equation to get the solution.
  - Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
    - It is very key to add these manual steps as comments so you can visualize as you code what needs to happen and where it needs to happen.
  - Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
    - After all the comments are in place and a clear route to the solution is seen then begin replacing the comments with actual code.
  - Optimize the real code.
    - Once achieved, go back and look through the code and see if this is the best way to get the solution and what steps can be removed.

## How to Think Like a Programmer

- Problem solving is the must have skill to have when it comes to programming.
- The worst way to problem solve is by trying a solution, and if it does not work then trying a new one, then repeating that.
- It is important to have a [Framework](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2)
  - Understand
    - In order to start solving a problem you need to fully understand what is being asked and understand what the expected outcome should be.
  - Plan
    - Do not just hop straight in to coding.
    - Have a plan of attack and allow your brain some time to analyze the plan and work it out.
  - Divide
    - Break the problem into smaller pieces and steps.
    - Trying to solve and code out the entire problem at once is very difficult to wrap your brain around.
  - Stuck?
    - This is where you can take a quick break and start the *debugging* process.
    - After that reassess where you at and what is going on. Can things be done simpler?
  - Practice
    - Like anything it requires a lot of practice to solidify the skill of problem solving.
    - Following steps and guidelines like this will help the process go smoother.

## The 5 Whys

- This method was developed by Sakichi Toyoda, the founder of Toyota.
  - [Source](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)
- It was created to help developers and businesses get to the bottom of why something is not working or why something is not being used or purchased.
- You simply start at the stop and ask why the problem is there, then keep asking why until an attainable tangible solution becomes visible.
- How to use the 5 Whys
  - Assemble a Team
    - This will add more minds to the mix and shorten the time needed to find the solution.
  - Define the Problem
    - This is the most important part that can spark the path to a solution.
  - Ask the First Why
    - Once the problem is discovered, ask the first why.
  - Why is this a problem?
  - Ask Why Four More Times
    - Keep asking why until you dig down to the route of the problem and create a solution to that problem.
  - Know When to Stop
    - When you get to the point where no more useful answers are coming, then stop.
  - Address the Root Cause
  - Monitor Your Measures
    - This means to watch how the counter measure works to solve the problem.

## [What the heck is the event loop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)

- The JavaScript is a *single threaded* language and has a **call stack** that determines the order of what will be executed first in the code.
- JavaScript works through one task at a time working from top to bottom because it is *asynchronous* code.
- The **event loop** is what keeps feeding the stack with tasks from the **task que**.
- This is an outcome of running a *callback function*

## [The Super Mario Effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0)

- This effect is when you fail at something, you do not quit, you remember where or what that failure was and learn from it and move on.
- This is important when it comes to programming because there will be many failures and the most important thing you can do is learn from those and keep positive.
