# CSS

- Cascading Style Sheets is the icing on the cake. HTML is the structure / layers of the cake .
- It is the language that describes how HTML elements will look and be displayed.
- CSS is used to add color, shape, design, layout, and more custom features.
- You can also move or `float: right;` pictures so text goes on the left and under. 

## CSS Syntax

- Instead of angle brackets, CSS uses curly brackets `{}`

 ```
 p {
     font-size: 10px;
     color: red;
 }

 ```

  - Be sure to end with `;` after your inputed value
- A **propoerty** is something that an element uses to describe how it looks.
 ```

 h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
}

```
  - The **selector** selects the HTML element we are going to style. 
  - In the case above the selector is `h1`
  - `color` is the **property** 
  - `red` is the **value** or try  `color: rbg(200,100,50);` which basically allows you to search and pick any color and shade!
  - There is also **Hex Value Colors** `rr,gg,b` or `1b,20,f9`

## CSS Specifications

- CSS is constantly developing and it is defined in giant documents called **specification** or *specs* 
- CSS specs are developed by a group in W3C calls the CSS Working Group.

## Browser Compatibility 

- Browser compatibility is something to think of when using CSS to create a webpage that might be used on a web broweser on a computer, or a web browser or app on a mobile device.
