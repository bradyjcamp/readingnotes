# HTML

## What is it?

- One of the most used languages when it comes to website development and coding
- It stands for Hypertext Markup Language
- HTML is the **Structure** of a website and usually is the first language used in creating and filling a website with content.

## What's in it?

- Its Syntax involves open tags `<>` and closing tags `</>`
  - An opening tag and closing will contain the name of an element inside the angle brackets. 
  - Within those tags is where you find the **content**.
- It also has **attributes**. 
  - Attributes can include more information about the element that you don't want present in the actual content.
  - There is an attribute name and call 
  ```
     <p class="my-note"> I love to eat pizza.</p>
    ```
    - `class` is the attribute name, and `my-note` is the value 

### Nesting

- Nesting is when you place an element inside of another element.
  ```
   <p> I <strong>love</strong> to eat pizza.</p>
  ```
- Notice there is the element `<strong></strong>` inside of `<p></p>`
- Always ensure that all elements are properly opened and closed.

### Content Structure

- HTML is mainly used for structure which is why there are a lot of elements pertaining to title, body, different levels of headings, and you can even add a navigational bar to the website and add a link to it! You can even add photos!

### Semantics

- Semantics is the meaning of a certain element or piece of code. In other words, if the element is assigning a role to what is the open and closed brackets, then it is a semantic element.
- Some examples include:
  - `<h1>`
  - `<nav>`
  - `<header>`
  - `<main>`
  - `<article>`

## Wireframe

- Wireframing is where you start when you are thinkning of a new website to create.
- After brainstorming some ideas and figuring out your target market, you create a wireframe of how you want your website to look
- This gives a visual you can refer to when writing your code for the website itself.
