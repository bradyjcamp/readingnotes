## What I learned about a *Growth Mindset* in my own words

A growth mindset is necessary to continue to learn and succeed in new fields or even the same field at different levels. It is what allows you to continue to push your mind to be consistently uncomfortable in order to achieve more knowledge at a faster pace.

## How to stay in a *Growth Mindset*

  1. Continue to work on being comfortable being uncomfortable.
  2. Engage in conversations that challenge you to learn new things or learn new ways to do things.
  3. Whenever you go through failure, instead of quitting, view it as an opportunity to improve on what you fail at.
> Don't worry about failure. Wory about the chances you miss when you don't even try.
