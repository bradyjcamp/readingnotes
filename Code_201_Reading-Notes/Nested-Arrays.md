# Nested arrays

- this will require a function with 2 loops in it. One for loop will be nested inside the other. [i] for one and [j] for the other.
- similar loop but the nested for loop will use a different index [j].

- the nested loop with had a for / if loop.
- the inner loop is faster becasue each time 

- 2D array

- nested array in array
  - arrays within an array
- to access number in nested array then you follow this format [i][i]

- outer loop will be hours array

- inner loop will loop through all stores.cookies array
- need to loop through stores array to get random cookie values
  - this is the fast loop


- use console.table to help break down 2d arrays
