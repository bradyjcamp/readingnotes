# Google's Quest to Build the Perfect Team

- Project Aristotle
  - This project was created to study and research on what high effective and efficient teams look like and how to create that atmosphere.
  - In total Google had looked at over 180 different teams from the company.
  - They asked questions like:
    - Did the team hang out outside of work?
    - Do they have similar hobbies?
    - Similar education backgrounds?
  - After over a year of reserach they concluded that understanding and influencing the groups **norms** were key to improving the teams.
- They also discovered that great teams usually all had high *average social sensitivity*
  - They all understood how people were feeling and were sensitive to how others might have ideas but were being quiet or shy and not sharing.

## Takeaways

- My takeaways on this is that great teams need to have some sort of social understanding of one another.
- We must understand where everyone comes from and what their personality is like.
- If someone is shy or a slower paced learner or worker then it is up to the team to be able to recognize that and help that team member.
