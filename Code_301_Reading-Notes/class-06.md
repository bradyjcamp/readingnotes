## Pair Programming

- Six reasons for pair programming:
  - **Greater efficiency**
    - Having two people look at a code base will greatly reduce the amount of time it takes to spot mistakes and debug.
  - **Engaged collaboration**
    - This means that when there are multiple programmers working together than one will be less likely to procrastinate.
  - **Learning from fellow students**
    - When is comes to programming there is always something you can learn from a fellow programmer or student.
    - It could be learning new code or just different ideas and strategies to handle bugs in the code.
  - **Social Skills**
    - Pair programming will shape and grow your communication skills which are important when needing to explain your code and also to communicate that you may need help.
  - **Job Interview Readiness**
    - Gives you experience explaining your code and how you are working through it because during the interview process you will need to do the same.
  - **Work Environment Readiness**
    - Most jobs will have your pair programming and it is a good idea to get some experience now!

- For me personally it has been very beneficial for me because of the learning aspect.
  - I learn from other students but also get the chance to sharpen my understanding through teaching or explaining why I am doing something to another student.
- It involves a *Driver* and a *Navigator*
  - The driver does all of the "physical work" by actually writing the code and sorting through files.
  - The navigator is the one telling the driver where to go and what to do.
