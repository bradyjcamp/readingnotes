# Git and Github

## Git

- A version control system
- Great tool for collaborative work
- Keeps history of changes to files
- Ability to view, apply, and remove changes
- Keep all of your project files in one repository 

Without a version control system, your files will save a brand new .docx. This will make multiple files in your folder. Using a version control system, when you edit and add or 'commit' a new version, it replaces the old one.
- Each commit(snapshot) has a label that points to it
- HEAD = the label meaning "you are here"
- you can also assign messages to commits
- messages are like writing a caption for your snapshot 

### Summary of git

- Git takes snapshots of your code at points in time
- Git keeps a history of what those snapshots look like
- Git has a special label, called HEAD, That means "you are here"

## Github

- Not git
- A way to share code with others
- An online place to store your code and edit or collaborate code
- It uses Git to help you manager your team's work
  - Version tracking
  - reviewing changes

## git + GitHub = Awesome

- With Git (version control) and GitHub (online code storage), you can :
  - Keep history of each file

## What is a repository?

- A collection fo files that you've told Git to pay attention to
  - Usually, one project = one repository
  - Large projects might have multiple repositories for different parts of their system
